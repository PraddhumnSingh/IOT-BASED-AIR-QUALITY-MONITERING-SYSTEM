# IOT-BASED-AIR-QUALITY-MONITERING-SYSTEM

IoT (Internet of Things) Air Quality Monitoring Systems are innovative technologies that utilize internet-connected sensors to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time. These systems aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information about various air pollutants and their concentrations in the environment.

Key components of an IoT air quality monitoring system typically include:

Sensors: Specialized sensors capable of detecting different air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and others.

Connectivity: These sensors are equipped with internet connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular) to transmit the collected data to a central server or cloud-based platform.

Data Processing and Analysis: The collected data is sent to a centralized server or cloud platform, where it is processed, analyzed, and converted into meaningful insights and visualizations.

Dashboard and Reporting: The system often provides a user-friendly dashboard or mobile application that allows users to access real-time air quality information, historical trends, and alerts if certain pollutant levels exceed safe thresholds.

Integration and Automation: IoT air quality monitoring systems can be integrated with other smart devices or environmental control systems to take automated actions based on the air quality data. For example, adjusting ventilation systems, issuing public alerts, or triggering air purifiers.

These systems have various applications, such as in smart cities, industrial areas, schools, homes, and public spaces. They play a crucial role in raising awareness about air pollution, helping individuals and organizations make informed decisions to mitigate its impact on health and the environment. Additionally, the data collected by these systems can contribute to research and policymaking to improve air quality standards and regulations.
